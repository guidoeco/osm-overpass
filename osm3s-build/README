This builds from source a OpenStreetMap Overpass server from source code in a docker image to then be copied via scp to a new docker osm3s-server image. The steps to complete this are:
0) Create a dockernet network:
$ docker network create --subnet 172.18.1.0/24 --gateway 172.18.1.254 dockernet
Then add a static host entry in /etc/hosts file or DNS entry for the osm3s-server:
172.18.1.4      osm3s-server

1) Download the latest version of the Overpass API http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/versions to the local directory
The latest version was 0.7.54 for this build was from here
http://dev.overpass-api.de/releases/osm-3s_v0.7.54.tar.gz

1) Run the build script:
$ ./build.sh

Auxillary scripts to stop and start the image and container once it is created, and when running gain root access are also provided

Troubleshooting:
The docker network configuration is based on setting up docker Class B local network called 'dockernet' with the command
$ docker network create --subnet 172.18.1.0/24 --gateway 172.18.1.254 dockernet
Then adding a static host entry in /etc/hosts file

172.18.1.4      osm3s-server

The OSM build and server containers are given the same IP address as they should not be run simulataneously
